    <h3> Details About Star wars and characters </h3>
    <p>
      The Star Wars saga was created by American filmmaker George Lucas and produced by Lucasfilm Ltd., the
      California-based entertainment company he founded in 1971. When Lucas retired in 2012, The Walt Disney Company
      acquired Lucasfilm and Disney continues to create stories about this galaxy far, far away.

      Star Wars encompasses 10 feature films (with an 11th out by the end of 2019), several television series and a
      plethora of novels, comic books, video games and other forms of entertainment, which now includes Star Wars:

      KEY TERMS

      Aurebesh

      The written language of the Star Wars galaxy.

      Blaster

      The term for “gun” in the Star Wars galaxy. These weapons come in two basic forms – pistols and rifles – with a
      wide variety of modifications depending on use – and user.

      Droid

      The term for robot in the Star Wars galaxy. There are many different types, with a wide range of complexity and
      specialties. Some are meant to accomplish simple or mechanical tasks, some are deployed in battle, and some can
      converse fluently with humans.

      The Force

      The phrase “may the Force be with you” is peppered throughout the Star Wars saga, referring to the mystical energy
      field generated by all life forms. Some beings in the Star Wars galaxy dedicate their lives to it, while others
      don’t believe in it. The Force is not good or evil, but it can be used for either – it has a light side and a dark
      side. Some are able to use the Force for a kind of extrasensory perception and power, moving objects with their
      minds, choking people from afar and other abilities.

      The First Order

      Following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War in “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,” some members of the Empire
      escaped into the far reaches of the galaxy, eventually resurfacing as the First Order. Ruling through force and
      fear, they seek to overthrow the New Republic.

      Hyperspace/Lightspeed

      Starships equipped with a hyperdrive can travel at lightspeed (faster than the speed of light) and access an
      alternate dimension known as “hyperspace.” This allows ships to travel hyperspace lanes and traverse great
      distances across the galaxy in a much shorter time than using sublight engines. The phrase “make the jump to
      lightspeed” is commonly used in the Star Wars galaxy when referring to accessing hyperspace. Stars stretch into
      lines of light when jumping to lightspeed, and hyperspace is identifiable by its mottled, pulsating waves of
      light.

      Jedi Order

      A noble group of protectors unified by their ability to tap into the power of the Force. The Jedi were the
      guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, until they were eradicated by Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine
      during the Galactic Civil War.

      Lightsaber

      The weapon of a Jedi, it can be used to cut through blast doors or enemies alike. Using the Force, a Jedi can
      predict and deflect incoming blaster bolts. At its heart is a kyber crystal that focuses energy into a blade; the
      crystal is attuned to the Force and connected to a Jedi on a deeply personal level.

      New Republic

      After the Rebel Alliance defeated the Empire at the Battle of Endor in “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,” the New
      Republic was formed to help govern the galaxy. Promoting peace and disarmament, the New Republic oversaw 30 years
      of tranquility but was divided in its response to the rise of the First Order.

      Outer Rim

      A remote, often lawless region of the galaxy on the edge of Wild Space, far from the more developed and populated
      Core Worlds.

      The Resistance

      A small, secretive, private military force founded by Rebel Alliance hero Leia Organa to monitor the actions of
      the First Order. The cash-strapped movement relies on credits, ships and equipment quietly funneled from the few
      New Republic senators who share her concerns.

      Star Wars: Datapad

      The Star Wars equivalent of an electronic tablet. When guests use the Play Disney Parks app* on their mobile
      devices while inside Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge, the app interface transforms to resemble a Star Wars: Datapad.

      Stormtroopers

      These elite shock troops are fanatically loyal to the First Order. They wear imposing white armor, which offers a
      range of survival equipment and temperature controls to allow the soldiers to survive in almost any environment.
      They wield blaster rifles with great skill and attack in hordes to overwhelm their enemies.

      Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31, 2019, at Disneyland Park in California.
